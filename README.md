This is Assignment 1 for IMTC 505, Fundamentals of Immersive Technologies. 
I added the following:
* A cube that can either move in the default direction or be controlled using the WASD on the keyboard.
* The color of the cube can be changed to a random color whenever the Space key is pressed.
* A trail of small cubes that follow the original cube.
* The trail also changes color randomly each time.
